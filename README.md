# Local Area MP3 Player

Server that plays music, controlled from Firefox by FlyWeb

How to start:

```
sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev libasound2-dev libavcodec-extra libav-tools
npm install
npm start
```

Then connect via FlyWeb. There should be no installation errors.

## On a Raspberry Pi

If errors occur on startup due to a missing `binding.js` file, try running the following commands in order. Installation appears not to be idempotent.

```
npm install bindings
npm install speaker
npm install lame
npm install youtube-dl
```
